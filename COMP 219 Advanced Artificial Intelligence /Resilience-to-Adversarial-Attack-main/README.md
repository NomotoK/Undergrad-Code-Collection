# Resilience-to-Adversarial-Attack
A student competition to address robustness and attack ability in deep learning

## Functions
There are two
code blocks corresponding to the training and the attack, respectively. The two code
blocks are filled with the simplest implementations representing the baseline methods,
and the participators are expected to replace the baseline methods with their own
implementations, in order to achieve better performance regarding how to find better adversarial attacks, and
how to train a deep learning model with better robustness to the adversarial
attacks.
